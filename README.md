# Neon Rexx

This is an implementation of the [Rexx programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rexx) written in [Neon](https://neon-lang.dev).
It is a pure interpreter and attempts to pass the "trip" tests in [Regina](https://regina-rexx.sourceforge.io).

This implementation is not production quality and exists mostly to demonstrate the capabilities of Neon.
